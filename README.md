# Techdegree Project
 Project 3 for Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree

 I was told it was okay to not use jQuery since that requirement has since been removed.

 I am going for an exceeds grade.  Please reject if this project does not meet exceeds.

 ## Overview
 I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called "FullStack Conf."
    . Added customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
    . Validated user input and provide helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

 ## Extra Credit
 Hide the "Color" label and select menu until a T-Shirt design is selected from the "Design" menu.

 Program error messages so that more information is provided depending on the error.

 Form provides real-time validation error messages.
